## PPT 

Function to automatically create powerpoint slides for missing zoonoses, hotspot maps, and biodiversity maps by country. 

### Repo contains 

1. R function to make ppt slides 
2. CSV of # of mammals per country, (with some data on waterbirds)

### Repo doesn't contain 

1. Map JPEG files 
2. Template PPT 
3. Any output PPTs

### Code fixes needed: 

1. Add a way to automatically select the row based on the name of the country to create slides for 
2. Add a loop to do everything all at once 
3. Way to trawl for and insert JPEG files 
3. Clean it up - everything is still very wordy. 

### Data fixes needed: 

1. Waterbird numbers for India + other countries in PREDICT 
2. Populate last 4 columns of CSV.
